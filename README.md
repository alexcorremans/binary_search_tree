This is a Ruby implementation of a binary search tree using a `Node` and a `BinarySearchTree` class. The tree itself is an array of Node objects, each node linking to its parent and child nodes. 

It builds a tree based on an unsorted array. I've assumed the array can't get sorted before the tree is built, meaning the tree can be unbalanced as per the assignment.
